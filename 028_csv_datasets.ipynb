    "# Large Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large amounts of structured text data we can also do some stuff to speed things up, though there are some key differences that lessen our toolkit:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Data manipulation (filtering out features, customized data cleanup, etc...) is far easier to do in a tabular format like a dataframe. If there is going to be a lot of that, and the data is really large, we can do the 'manual' prep separately, write the data to a file, and then read it in again as ready-to-use data. </li>\n",
    "<li> As the data gets really large, most real life scenarios will either use big data approaches like Spark, or store structured data in a DB. That's the 'real' way to deal with large amounts of strucutred data, so there are not as many easy to use tools for this as we find with images. </li>\n",
    "<li> Further to the two ponts above, if the dataset is a CSV, we can likely load it into memory in its entirety as \"too many rows to fit in memory\" and \"this data is stored in a CSV file\" tend not to come around together all that often in a situation where there is actual infrastructure. </li>\n",
    "<li> Really large amounts of text can be broken into multiple smaller files, then we load a file at a time, similar to how we deal with images. This is common with NLP text, much more so than structured data. </li>\n",
    "<li> There is often an assumption that when needing to deal with large amounts of structured CSV data that we have the data already split into training and validation sets. This makes sense, as \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the whole, dealing with large amounts of structured data tends to not be as large of an issue to be solved as dealing with large amounts of unstrucutured data in a non-big data environment. This is because huge data goes to big data strategies, or at least a DB, less huge data can just fit in memory and be dealt with how we have dealt with all other CSV based data. \n",

    "## TensorFlow Datasets\n",

    "Tensorflow Datasets are something that we used when loading image files from disk, as loading all of the data at once can be impossible for larger datasets. These datasets serve the same function as a regular dataframe for modle training purposes, but they are designed more to be able to efficiently load large amounts of data from disk than to allow easy viewing and manipulation of the data. \n",

    "We can also use the faster and more efficient Polars DataFrame to load the data. This is a DataFrame that is written in Rust, and is much faster than Pandas. Polars dataframes aren't promised to be a one-to-one replacement for Pandas, but they are very similar, and can be used in most cases where Pandas is used with few, if any, changes.\n",

    "#### Polars Specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "Polars offers a fair bit of stuff for performance, as that is it's main selling point. Among them:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Low memory parameter - this will try to load the data in a way that uses less memory, but may be slower. </li>\n",
    "<li> Lazy execution - Polars has options to work lazily, which means that it won't actually do work like loading data until it is needed. </li>\n",
    "<li> Parallel execution - Polars can use multiple threads to do work, which can speed things up. </li>\n",

One thing that may be useful with Polars would be to split a very large csv into multiple smallers ones, that could then be loaded one at a time. Something like the function below could be adapted to load a csv into a Polars dataframe, do whatever data manipulation is needed, then write it out to several smaller csv files. The make_csv_dataset is able to natively read in multiple csv files. \n",
