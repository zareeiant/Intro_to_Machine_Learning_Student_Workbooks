        "\n",
        "### What Size to Use?\n",
        "\n",
        "We can start with a few guidelines to have a reasonably sized neural network. These steps do not ensure an optimal solution, but they'll get us started. There really is not a prescribed method for calculating the optimal network size (beleive me, I've looked), but there are several rules of thumb we can build together to get a rough estimate of a starting point for sizing:\n",

        "    <li> A reasonably large number if the feature set is large. \n",
        "    <li> We don't have a true diving line, but 512 is a reasonable value to try for an upper end, at least at first. \n",
        "    </ul>\n",
        "<li> Add 1 or 2 hidden layers of the same size and observe the results. We want to keep the model smaller if making it larger doesn't improve things, so first we shoudl see how good of a job a small model does. If the data is very large, skipping past the 1 layer step may save some time since we can predict that we can do better with a larger model in advance. \n",
        "<li> Increase layers of the same size until we get some overfitting and the training loss flattens. We want to reach the point where the model is getting to be excellent at predicting the training data. This is something we can see in the plot by noticing that the validation loss flatlines or starts to get worse. The training loss flattening is an indication that the model is not getting any better at learning the training data; we can use early stopping with a loose patience setting on training loss and lots of epochs to find this. \n",
        "<li> Add regularization steps to cut down that overfitting. We can try regularization and dropouts to cut down on that overfitting. We probably want to try a few options, parameters, and combinations here, there's not really a way to know in advance which regularization will work best on our data. \n",
        "<li> Do a test of \"funneling\" the layer size, potentially adding more layers. The traditional configuration of layers is to gradually decrease the size from the input layer towards the output layer. There is open debate on if this is better than having layers that are all the same size. We can play with this a little to see if results improve or not. \n",
        "<li> Use pruning. Much like a tree we can prune back a model to fight overfitting. \n",

        "\n",
        "Another begged question is should we make networks wider (more neurons) or deeper (more layers)? To that effect, we can also think about what happens as layers are added. Each layer allows the network to learn a different representation of the data, and if we flash back to the simple logistic regression and XOR examples, each layer allows the model to capture relationships that are more complex:\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li> No hidden layers - linear relationships only. \n",
        "<li> 1 or more hidden layers - nonlinear relationships, of increasing complexity.\n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "\n",
        "So the number of layers in our model directly relates to the complexity of relationships that we can capture. This doesn't directly mean that more layers are better, but it generally means that we want the number of layers to mirror the \"complexity\" of the data, though complexity is a term with no exact definition or metric here. Once again, there's no universal answer on the balance between width of layers and number of layers, but the general evidence leans towards more layers. There are several reasons for this, none of them definitive, but taken as a whole they add up to a strong case:\n",
        "\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li> Ability to learn different representation of the data - this will be more clear next time when we start to look at some image specific neural networks, but one of the cool features of neural networks is that at each layer the network \"sees\" a different representation of the data, as it goes through each round of transformations. This has the effect of allowing it to identify different features at each layer, and use those features to make more and more accurate predictions. We'll examine this more soon. \n",
        "<li> Avoiding overfitting - extremely wide neural networks tend towards overfitting the training data and not generalizing as well to new data. \n",
        "<li> Ability to add interim steps - with a multi layer network we can add multiple steps such as regularization or dropouts, again to fight overfitting. \n",
        "<li> Automatic feature selection - deep neural networks will automatically perform a type of feature selection as the least important features are minimized in their importance. This is an emerging area of research - some people have argued that well designed neural networks can remove the need for feature selection, and neural networks are being created to be feature selection tools. We can see this illustrated most clearly with images again, we feed a network an entire image, and get a prediction. Note that this isn't a total rejection of feature selection for neural networks, improving the feature set will impact neural network models just as it will for ordinary models; with neural networks we just have the potential for the network to \"cover for mistakes\" in the features. This is more dramatic as data size and network size increase. \n",
        "<li> Results - deep learning has become a common term recently for a reason, due to the success of deep neural networks with many layers. Most of the cool stuff that we see coming from AI such as image recognition, translation, and self navigating robots are the result of deep learning networks. In practice these networks have tended to outperform shallower ones, especially in more complex tasks. \n",

        "\n",
        "Why not make a model that is both very wide and very deep? This will tend to overfit as it can \"memorize\" the training data. With large datasets we do see very large models in some cases, since the more data we have, the more fitting we can handle. With large datasets and huge models, the training time can potentially explode, so we have to be careful. This is similar to what we saw with unlimited size in trees, we can eventually create a model large enough to memorize the training data. On the whole, the model capacity can be thought of similarly to the size of a tree. If we have large amounts of complex data, we want a model that has a very high capacity, as the relationships are complicated and we have enough data to mitigate overfitting. If we have smaller or more simple data, we want a smaller model, as a large one will overfit our data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finding the \"optimal\" size is still somewhat of an art, combined with patience for trial and error. <b>The easiest starting point is probably to create a model that can potentially overfit, though not comically large, then use some regularization techniques and early stopping to find the optimal fit.</b> We should also note that it is possible and reasonable that models of different sizes and configurations tend to converge on similar levels of performace. These neural networks are extremely flexible in how they learn during the training process, so they can \"learn around\" some degree of design decisions in a way that is more dramatic than our previous models.

The batch sizes are a matter of very open debate for the optimal solution. At the high end, batch sizes are limited by what can fit in memory. When dealing with very large data this may matter as a batch that is a small fraction of the data may be a massive absolute size. At the lower end using smaller batches gives the same effect as it does when we looked at regular gradient descent - the gradients become less stable as we are relying on a smaller number of records. In reading more about batch sizes I want to update my recommendation to be even smaller than the 50 to 150 I suggested before, down to less than 100, even as small as into the single digits. There is research that smaller batch sizes tend to produce models that generalize better than ones with larger batches. \n",

One thing that you see in practice is that the GPUs (or similar) that are used to train neural networks have a certain amount of memory, and the batch size is limited by that memory. When doing something that involves large images or video, or similar, this can be a real area for concern. For us, these constraints won't really come up, but it's good to be aware of them. \n",

The biggest impact of the optimizer is on the speed of the training process, and in turn the ability to experiment with different models.

This can happen when we get inputs to the activation function fall in the negative area.

This is a common problem in things such as fraud detection, where we have a very small number of fraud cases, and a very large number of non-fraud cases. Seeding the model with an \"expectation\" of the bias values can help the model learn faster and converge on an answer more quickly. In cases where we have a lot of data, this can be a big deal. In cases where we may have local minima in the loss curve, this can be significant - the more \"ground\" the gradient descent covers, the greater the odds it encounters a local minima that might be a trap. With imbalenced data, we expect that the model will need to cover a lot of that ground, so starting off with a better bias value can help. \n",

        "We can also use pruning to improve our networks, which is built into Tensorflow and is similar in concept to the tree pruning we did earlier. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Pruning Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Pruning removes the least useful weights, increasing sparsity. These sparse models require less processing (since many calculations will be M * 0) and may be compressed down to take less space in memory. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Smaller Models\n",
        "\n",
        "One other consideration is that we can use pruning to create smaller models that are better able to be executed on weaker hardware. In the context of a full computer, creating a prediction with a neural network is pretty fast. If we want to move the model to small embedded devices though, the memory and processing needs can still be excessive. Some scenarios where this comes up are things like security cameras that can recognize images, robots that can navigate themselves, or evern small computers like a Raspberry Pi. For example, if you have a self driving small car, you may collect training data from the car's camera and sensors (throttle, steering, etc..), train a model that can produce a \"how to drive\" prediction on a computer, then export a condensed version of that model that can run on the car's smaller low powered processor to make the predictions as the car drives. This challenge is magnified if you are dealing with something like video, which can generate 30+ images per second. Small models that are almost as good, but can be run with less compouting power allow the power of neural networks to be expanded to more devices - train on a powerful computer, us on a small and weak computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the tflite set of tools to create special models that are optimized for lower computing power devices, though we won't explore that here. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** pruning is largely a step that is for deployment of models, as we can make the processing more efficient and the memory required lesser. For us, it isn't the most critical of steps. In general, a smaller model that produces the same or similar accuracy is better, as you can do more with less. The reduction of overfitting and potential accuracy benefits are somewhat secondary to making the model more usable in practice. "
