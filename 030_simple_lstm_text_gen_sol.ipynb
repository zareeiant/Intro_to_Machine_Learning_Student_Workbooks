    "As we have seen, LSTM models are excellent at dealing with sequential data. As luck would have it, text is also sequental data! We can train a model to predict the next word in a sentence, then use that smarts to generate new text. Basically ChatGPT, but far better. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text for Training\n",
    "\n",
    "We need some text from which to train our model to speak, I captured a small extract of text from Reddit posts, which vaguely resembles actual language. We'll first need to clean up our data a bit before we can assemble it for modelling. The inital cleaning bits are just like what we used in NLP, we just need to get rid of all the junk. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use pretty much anything that you can imagine as source, and assuming we can gather enough data and train our model, the generated speech will be styled after the source. I liken it to going on vacation in Indonesia and talking to Indonesians who spoke English like Australian surfer bros - their training data was a little weird, so the output was a little weird too. If you're looking to build your best ChatGPT competitor you will want a lot of data, specifically a lot of data that is representative of the full gamut of how you want your model to write. If you want slang in the new text, you can't really train on Shakespeare and Wikipedia."

    "\n",
    "Now we model. The data that we made mirrors the construction of a sentence.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> X features - the sentence up to this point. \n",
    "<li> Y target - the word(s) that should come next. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the model is effectively working to generate text just like a time series model works to predict the next value in a sequence of stock prices or hourly temperature. We train the model on, hopefully a large number of senteneces, where is sees many examples of \"here are some words\" (X values) and \"here is the next word\" (Y value). If we give it lots and lots of that training data, it should become better and better at determining what should come next, given the existing sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this well, we'd need a lot more data than we have, and much more time to train. We'd want to give the model enough data so that it can see lots and lots of examples of the same word in different contexts, and of similar contexts with different words. The patterns of language are really complex, so we need data that provides enough variation to demonstrate the patterns. <b>The actual performance of our model at creating sensible text will be bad, we should not get our hopes up, but the process is sound.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embedding Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use an embedding layer here, which accepts our integer inputs and converts them to a vector of a specified size. This is a way of representing the words in a way that is more useful for the model. We saw embeddings with word2vec during the NLP portions. Just as it did then, embedding will represent each of our tokens as a vector of a specified size, or as a value in N dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Embedding](images/embedding.png \"Embedding\")\n",
    "\n",
    "When we check the summary of the model we can see that the embedding layer has a lot of parameters, this is because it is learning the vector representation of each of the words in our vocabulary. When we used word2vec we used a pretrained model - the N dimensional space was already defined, and we placed our words into it. Here, we are letting the model learn the space and the vectors that represent the words, so the vector representation of each word is learned directly from the data. If we are dealing with a scenarion where we have a lot of data and a specialized vocabulary (such as in industry) this can be very useful. The model will learn which words are similar and which are not, based on the context of the text provided in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider embedding from the perspective of the actual prediction, it also makes a lot of sense that this is a prefered approach. We are not generally trying to predict the exact word, as we would with a classification that chooses the correct answer from a list of options. When dealing with language we are more likely trying to predict the next <i>type</i> of word - both if it is a noun/verb/etc and the meaning. Embedding the words allows us to use that multidimensional representation aim for words that are similar. When dealing with generative models with large vocabularies our model will follow \"Do you want to go out sometime and grab a ________\" with something like \"beer\" or \"coffee\" which are similar in this context, and close in their embedding representation. Using embeddings, the loss that is calculated each round is measuring the distance between the predicted word and the actual word in N dimensions, so grabbing words that are very close, or similar, is expected and desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's Go Bi\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model we'll use a bidirectional LSTM layer. This is a layer that will process the input sequence in both directions, so it will see the sequence from the beginning and from the end. This is useful because it allows the model to consider what should come next, but also what should come before, which can be useful for determining the next word. The idea of a bidirectional layer is that if our data is in a sequence we can feed it through normally, but we can also reverse it. Doing this gives the model a differnet view on the data, and especially in cases like language creation, where the meaning of the output can depend on the entirety of the sequence. \n",

    "Bidirectional layers are most prevalent in NLP, as adding the ability to look at the sequence of words in both directions can really help models build a better understanding of the context of the words. There is a speed penalty due to each layer doing roughly double the number of calculations, but for language tasks such as this, it is pretty likely to be worth it, particularly if we were to expand the dataset. Bidirectional layers can be added simply, as below; on the Keras documentation there are a few more details, mainly that the forward and backward layers can be configured separately then combined. When using a bidirectional layer, one option that we should commonly pay attention to is the \"merge_mode\" option, which determines how the forward and backward layers are combined to produce the final output. The default is \"concat\" which combines the outputs by concatenating them, but there are other options such as \"sum\" or \"ave\" which can be useful in some cases - hyperparameter tuning is the way to find the \"best\" option. We will use the default here, and can sidestep the other details of bidirectional layers for now."

    "### Generate Some Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate text once the model is trained. We'll start with a seed sentence, and then we'll use the model to predict the next word. We'll then append that word to the sentence and use the model to predict the next word, and so on. There is a little helper function to do this for us with limited repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another new thing is that we create an inverse dictionary to map the encoded words back to the original words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "One weirdly named factor that is important in text generation is the temperature. The temperature is a factor that we can use to control the randomness of the output. To generate text, we are essentially using a probability distribution to determine what the next word should be - the softmax output of the model will tell us the most likely next word. The issue is that certain words are way more likely than others - \"the\", \"it\", \"a\", \"and\", etc. are all very common words so we can expect the model to predict them as \"most likely\" a lot, probably too often. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Temperature](images/temperature.gif \"Temperature\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct way to combat this is to add some degree of randomness to which word we select - we'll still pick the most likely word more often than any other, but we'll also pick other words that have some degree of likelihood at random. The higher the temperature the more randomness is introduced. A correct value requires tuning with human feedback, and it'll vary depending on the base quality of the model - large models that are trained on huge volumes of text and are deep enough to pick up on the \"what type of word should be here\" patterns will be able to generate better text with lower temperatures. Our model here is small and kind of sucks, so the temperature needs to be higher to get anything remotely usable. The implementation here is stolen shamelessly from the internet, the details don't really matter all that much, we just need to vary our predictions away from always simply picking the most likely word."
