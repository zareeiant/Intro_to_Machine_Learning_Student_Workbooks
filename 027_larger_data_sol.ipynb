    "When dealing with larger amounts of data in our neural networks we need some tools to manage the data pipeline. We have started to look at a couple of these in the image generators and the datasets from directories. We can build on the dataset specifically to create data pipelines that both apply any data preparation steps and load our data efficiently. The TensorFlow documentation has a great article on the details of pipeline speed with timed examples and visuals of the process, [Efficiently loading data from disk](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance). \n",

We'll focus only on those here. Some articles said it is up to 30 times faster, which is pretty massive. Even if the difference isn't near that much, it is substantial, so the datasets will be more efficient for larger data. "

    "\n",
    "The data pipeline setup in tensorflow is a little different than what we are used to in sklearn. Here, the big thing that our pipeline is going to do for us is to offer greater efficiency. Neural networks are generally used with very large datasets that are too large to fint in memory, like a dataframe that we are used to using. The tensorflow pipeline works to pull the data off of disk and into memory in a way that efficiently uses resources. The pipeline that we create will do a better job of ensuring that data is being prepared while the model is training, and is prepped and ready to go without delay, which can really matter with large datasets. The way that it does this is to do a better job of batching and processing the data, to ensure that we waste as little time idle as possible. Recall that when training models we normally use the GPU (graphics processor) becuase it is way faster, but most of the work outside of the fit method still relies on the CPU. The data pipelines work to make sure that the CPU can process and prepare data in parallel with the GPU doing the fitting, so as soon as one batch is finished processing, another is ready to go. Less delay means more of the run time spent processing rather than waiting. \n",

When we are dealing with something like images, that type of data prep isn't really relevant. If we were applying this to structured data, cleanup steps could be applied through the .map() function, or we could just clean it before starting the modelling. \n",

    "### Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization is something that we've used before, but not discussed in detail. In short, vectorization is applying some action to an entire dataset without doing a loop. For example, if we wanted to take the square root of every item in a list we could write a loop that looks at each item and takes its square root, or we could use something like <b>map(lambda x:x*x,numbers)</b> to do the same thing. The end result is the same, but the system is able to compute the vector operation much more quickly. We saw an example of this in the neural network made from scratch - there are operations on the large matricies of weights calculated at each step of the process, those operations are done with vector operations like the dot product rather than a loop for efficiency. The same thing applies here, we want to do as much of the data prep as possible with vector operations. The python language has very fast internal operations for doing these vector operations efficiently, while things in a loop need to be done the \"standard\" way. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a bit of a side note, this is an illustration of one of the examples of a downside of using an interpreted language like Python - i.e. a language that goes immediately from code to output, like what happens in our notebook when we click run. If you are using something like C++, the code is first compiled before it runs, or translated into machine code, the actual instructions that the computer understands. These compilers that do the translation are often quite smart, and will look to do things like optimize the code for efficiency. This can include profiling what a loop does and transforming it into a more efficient calculation. In general, code that is compiled is far faster than code that is interpreted, however that extra step makes development more cumbersome - the ability to just run one box of code at a time while we are creating models is really convinient. It is common for parts of the things that we call in Python, including Tensorflow itself, to have the performance critical bits to be written in a language like C++ for speed, then endpoints are provided so we can easily use it in Python. For something like machine learning this works quite well, most of the development is kind of the back and forth exploration and experimentation that benefits from the easy to update notebooks, while most of the processing time ends up being dominated by the training step, which can benefit from being implemented in another language that is faster, and isn't constrained by the code we write in Python. \n",

This map function will apply itself to the dataset, so we can do things like normalization here if we choose. \n",

In addition to making the voice of T-Pain resemble that of an angel, autotune works to make our data pipeline more efficient by monitoring some metrics on performance as the dataset works, and automatically making adjustments to improve things. The ramp-up process for the autotune to learn can impose some performance penalties on the early steps of training as the algorithm is analyzing the data, but once it learns an optimal set of values the efficiency will improve. This makes the autotune tool good for larger and longer training times, as the inital tuning time will become negligable as training progresses. "

Here, swapping data to disk is so much slower that it is essentially impossible, so if we put 16.1GB in 16GB of RAM, everything dies. The most likely culprits are things that try to do something to all the data at once, it is likely that with larger datasets such actions aren't even possible. We can use the .map() function in the dataset to apply things to the dataset in a managed way. There are models, like some of the larger image or NLP ones, that can't run on normal consumer hardware because the RAM requirements on the GPU are too large. We can see something similar on a smaller scale with smart robotic toys, the ones that use something like a Raspberry Pi or other small computer as a programmable brain. Some of these can be AI driven by loading a neural network model that was trained elsewhere (your laptop) on that makes the speed and steering decisions based on what it sees and senses; that model can only be so large though as the small single board computers are limited in their capacity. \n",

The wonky stuff in the file name just assigns each set of weights saved with a label of their epoch and accuracy, a common way to log multiple sets of weights. As well, the adam optimizer gave me quite poor results on this one, so I tried a different one, rmsprop. RMSprop is another of the common optimizer algorithms and is generally good and efficient, just like adam. The effective difference is that rmsprop tends to change direction more quickly, while adam is more aggressive about \"going down the gradient descent slope\" quickly.

This is because these advanced activations have something that is learned in training. The end effect in the structure and functionality of the model doesn't change, it is simply to allow the way things are implemented in tensorflow to function correctly. If you recall the scratch-made neural network that we started with, those activations were were also added as a separate layer there.  "

    "### Setting up a Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "These pipelines result in a balance of memory usage vs. speed - we can load a bunch more stuff in memory to make it faster, or we can endure losses in speed to save memory. Ideally, in a real world setting, we have some system (real or virtual) that we are using to train our models and we want to set things up to utilize those resources as fully as possible. On colab, the RAM we are allocated isn't massive, so we may not be able to lean really heavily on some of the functionality here to preload our data. If we were doing a similar task in a \"real\" scenario, it would be pretty easy for us to allocate or buy something like 64GB of RAM and really utilize it to ensure that both the CPU and GPU have work to do all the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since RAM is likely the limiting factor when we are using colab, configuration of the pipeline also allows us to tailor the memory usage of our model to fit the constraints. For example, this is a snapshot of the RAM usage of this code with the buffer for shuffle set to 8, the prefetch suing autotune, and the batch size set to 8. We could bump these up a bit, and since the resource usage tends to flatten out once everything starts up it won't be too difficult to get our resource usage pretty close to the limit. \n",

    "![RAM Usage](images/flat_ram_usage2.png \"Flat Ram\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing the batch size when there is a lot of data to process will generally make the training process faster as there is less wasted capacity in the GPU on each batch. For larger datasets this is probably a larger concern than what we saw when we first touched on batch size - that we likely want it small for the best results. Even if a smaller batch performs better in a vacuum, faster epochs mean we can train and experiment more, which will likely outweigh any improvements that a small batch may bring. If we are dealing with images, a \"large batch\" probably won't be that large anyway. So, tl;dr, if using a large and slow model, fill the GPU with the largest batch it can take. "

    "## Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the things that we need to do to create ML models is somewhat automatable, particularly the parts around fitting and tuning a model. Experimenting with things like number of neurons in a neural network or different combinations of hyperparameters for any model is something that can be automated and many tools exist to do this. The goal of these tools is generally to make the process of creating machine learning models more accessible to people who don't have a lot of experience with the process. Current tools, and likely ones that will exist in the near future, aren't smart enough to totally replace all the work we need to do, but they can replace parts of it and they are getting better all the time. This is conjecture, but I'd anticipate that true breakthroughs in the capabilities of automated machine learning will explode as more and more services are moved to cloud services. The corporate market, filled with large amounts of data and few people who really analyze it, makes for a promising market, and the semi-standardization in the data that will come as more customers use cloud tools offered by one a few providers (AWS, Azure, Google) solves one of the biggest challenges to automating the process - variation. Companies forecasting sales, predicing loan defaults, or segmenting customers are all doing the same fundamental task, if the data is highly consistent coming out of the same systems, it makes it much easier to design an automated ML workflow that needs little to no human intervention. The machine learning bits can just be another service that the cloud providers can sell to their clients. \n",

    "The automation does save us the time of making a model, deciding on a structure, and picking hyperparameters, but that definitely isn't all the work and I'd say not really the hardest part of the process. The work in getting and prepping the data to go into the model, automated or not, is probably more challenging and complex than making a model to do the predicting. If you're designing complex models to do chatGPTesque breakthroughs this may not hold true, but these automodels aren't doing anything that complex. This is why I think that automated machine learning will be most useful in the corporate world, where the data is (often) highly consistent and the models are relatively simple."
