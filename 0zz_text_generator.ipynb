    "utility requires a `token_logits_fn()` wrapper around the model. This wrapper takes\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating the wrapper function is the most complex part of using these functions. Now that\n",
    "it's done, let's test out the different utilties, starting with greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy search\n",
    "\n",
    "We greedily pick the most probable token at each timestep. In other words, we get the\n",
    "argmax of the model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "output_tokens = keras_nlp.utils.greedy_search(\n",
    "    token_logits_fn,\n",
    "    prompt_tokens,\n",

    ")\n",
    "txt = tokenizer.detokenize(output_tokens)\n",
    "print(f\"Greedy search generated text: \\n{txt}\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, greedy search starts out making some sense, but quickly starts repeating\n",
    "itself. This is a common problem with text generation that can be fixed by some of the\n",
    "probabilistic text generation utilities shown later on!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beam search\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, beam search keeps track of the `num_beams` most probable sequences at\n",
    "each timestep, and predicts the best next token from all sequences. It is an improvement\n",
    "over greedy search since it stores more possibilities. However, it is less efficient than\n",
    "greedy search since it has to compute and store multiple potential sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** beam search with `num_beams=1` is identical to greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "output_tokens = keras_nlp.utils.beam_search(\n",
    "    token_logits_fn,\n",
    "    prompt_tokens,\n",
    "    max_length=NUM_TOKENS_TO_GENERATE,\n",
    "    num_beams=10,\n",

    ")\n",
    "txt = tokenizer.detokenize(output_tokens)\n",
    "print(f\"Beam search generated text: \\n{txt}\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to greedy search, beam search quickly starts repeating itself, since it is still\n",
    "a deterministic method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random search\n",
    "\n",
    "Random search is our first probabilistic method. At each time step, it samples the next\n",
    "token using the softmax probabilities provided by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "output_tokens = keras_nlp.utils.random_search(\n",
    "    token_logits_fn,\n",
    "    prompt_tokens,\n",

    "appearing since any word in the vocabulary has a chance of appearing with this sampling\n",
    "method. This is fixed by our next search utility, top-k search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-K search\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to random search, we sample the next token from the probability distribution\n",
    "provided by the model. The only difference is that here, we select out the top `k` most\n",
    "probable tokens, and distribute the probabiltiy mass over them before sampling. This way,\n",
    "we won't be sampling from low probability tokens, and hence we would have less\n",
    "nonsensical words!\n",
