        "\n",

        "We can start with a few guidelines to have a reasonably sized neural network. These steps do not ensure an optimal solution, but they'll get us started. There really is not a prescribed method for calculating the optimal network size (beleive me, I've looked), but there are several rules of thumb we can build together:\n",

        "    <ul>\n",
        "    <li> The width of the data, if the feature set is relatively small. \n",
        "    <li> A reasonably large number if the feature set is large. \n",
        "    <li> We don't have a true diving line, but 512 is a reasonable value to try for an upper end, at least at first. \n",
        "    </ul>\n",
        "<li> Add 1 or 2 hidden layers of the same size and observe the results. We want to keep the model smaller if making it larger doesn't improve things, so first we shoudl see how good of a job a small model does. If the data is very large, skipping past the 1 layer step may save some time since we can predict that we can do better with a larger model in advance. \n",
        "<li> Increase layers of the same size until we get some overfitting and the training loss flattens. We want to reach the point where the model is getting to be excellent at predicting the training data. This is something we can see in the plot by noticing that the validation loss flatlines or starts to get worse. The training loss flattening is an indication that the model is not getting any better at learning the training data; we can use early stopping with a loose patience setting on training loss and lots of epochs to find this. \n",
        "<li> Add regularization steps to cut down that overfitting. We can try regularization and dropouts to cut down on that overfitting. We probably want to try a few options, parameters, and combinations here, there's not really a way to know in advance which regularization will work best on our data. \n",
        "<li> \"Funnel\" the layer size, potentially adding more layers. The traditional configuration of layers is to gradually decrease the size from the input layer towards the output layer. There is open debate on if this is better than having layers that are all the same size. We can play with this a little to see if results improve or not. \n",
        "<li> Use pruning. Much like a tree we can prune back a model to fight overfitting. \n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Height vs Width\n",
        "\n",
        "Another begged question is should we make networks wider (more neurons) or deeper (more layers)? Once again, there's no universal answer, but the general evidence leans towards more layers. There are several reasons for this, none of them definitive, but taken as a whole they add up to a strong case:\n",
        "\n",
        "<ul>\n",
        "<li> Ability to learn different representation of the data - this will be more clear next time when we start to look at some image specific neural networks, but one of the cool features of neural networks is that at each layer the network \"sees\" a different representation of the data, as it goes through each round of transformations. This has the effect of allowing it to identify different features at each layer, and use those features to make more and more accurate predictions. We'll examine this more soon. \n",
        "<li> Avoiding overfitting - extremely wide neural networks tend towards overfitting the training data and not generalizing as well to new data. \n",
        "<li> Ability to add interim steps - with a multi layer network we can add multiple steps such as regularization or dropouts, again to fight overfitting. \n",
        "<li> Automatic feature selection - deep neural networks will automatically perform a type of feature selection as the least important features are minimized in their importance. This is an emerging area of research - some people have argued that well designed neural networks can remove the need for feature selection, and neural networks are being created to be feature selection tools. We can see this illustrated most clearly with images again, we feed a network an entire image, and get a prediction. Note that this isn't a total rejection of feature selection for neural networks, improving the feature set will impact neural network models just as it will for ordinary models; with neural networks we just have the potential for the network to \"cover for mistakes\" in the features. This is more dramatic as data size and network size increase. \n",
        "<li> Results - deep learning has become a common term recently for a reason, due to the success of deep neural networks with many layers. Most of the cool stuff that we see coming from AI such as image recognition, translation, and self navigating robots are the result of deep learning networks. In practice these networks have tended to outperform shallower ones, especially in more complex tasks. \n",
        "</ul>\n",
        "\n",
        "Why not make a model that is both very wide and very deep? This will tend to overfit as it can \"memorize\" the training data. With large datasets we do see very large models in some cases, since the more data we have, the more fitting we can handle. With large datasets and huge models, the training time can potentially explode, so we have to be careful."

        "\n",
        "Batch size determines how many records are processed before the gradients are updated - i.e. the number of records between one forward and backwards pass. The batch sizes are a matter of very open debate for the optimal solution. At the high end, batch sizes are limited by what can fit in memory. When dealing with very large data this may matter as a batch that is a small fraction of the data may be a massive absolute size. At the lower end using smaller batches gives the same effect as it does when we looked at regular gradient descent - the gradients become less stable as we are relying on a smaller number of records. In reading more about batch sizes I want to update my recommendation to be even smaller than the 50 to 150 I suggested before, down to less than 100, even as small as into the single digits. There is research that smaller batch sizes tend to produce models that generalize better than ones with larger batches. \n",
        "\n",
        "Larger batch sizes do tend to be processed more quickly, sometimes substantially so, as the hardware is better able to be \"saturated\" with data to process. In big data scenarios, this can matter. One thing that you see in practice is that the GPUs (or similar) that are used to train neural networks have a certain amount of memory, and the batch size is limited by that memory. When doing something that involves large images or video, or similar, this can be a real area for concern. For us, these constraints won't really come up, but it's good to be aware of them. \n",

        "Dont' stress too much on batch size, this is really something that needs to be grid searched to find a great answer. "

By default the initial values are randomized, so the model needs to learn the skew towards the imbalance - if the balance between classes is moderate, that's not a big deal; if the balance is so drastically skewed in one direction, that's less practical. With the preset bias we can speed convergance and likely reduce loss. \n",

        "## Pruning\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also use pruning to improve our networks, which is built into Tensorflow and is similar in concept to the tree pruning we did earlier. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Pruning Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Pruning removes the least useful weights, increasing sparsity. These sparse models require less processing (since many calculations will be M * 0) and may be compressed down to take less space in memory. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Smaller Models\n",
        "\n",
        "One other consideration is that we can use pruning to create smaller models that are better able to be executed on weaker hardware. In the context of a full computer, creating a prediction with a neural network is pretty fast. If we want to move the model to small embedded devices though, the memory and processing needs can still be excessive. Some scenarios where this comes up are things like security cameras that can recognize images, robots that can navigate themselves, or evern small computers like a Raspberry Pi. For example, if you have a self driving small car, you may collect training data from the car's camera and sensors (throttle, steering, etc..), train a model that can produce a \"how to drive\" prediction on a computer, then export a condensed version of that model that can run on the car's smaller low powered processor to make the predictions as the car drives. This challenge is magnified if you are dealing with something like video, which can generate 30+ images per second. Small models that are almost as good, but can be run with less compouting power allow the power of neural networks to be expanded to more devices - train on a powerful computer, us on a small and weak computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the tflite set of tools to create special models that are optimized for lower computing power devices, though we won't explore that here. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** pruning is largely a step that is for deployment of models, as we can make the processing more efficient and the memory required lesser. For us, it isn't the most critical of steps. In general, a smaller model that produces the same or similar accuracy is better, as you can do more with less. The reduction of overfitting and potential accuracy benefits are somewhat secondary to making the model more usable in practice. "
