    "We've mentioned that the word2vec model we are making is a neural network. Neural networks, as we'll see later, have an architecture, or basically a size and design. The details don't matter too much to us yet, but one thing that we can change when determing our model in word2vec is that architecture - we can choose between CBOW and Skip-Gram. These two options are roughly opposites of each other. The details of how they work and how they differ are neural network details, so we'll set those details aside for now.\n",

    "<b>Note:</b> the similarites here are calculated by the values derived from our trained model. So they are based on the relationships in our text. Word2Vec and other NLP packages also commonly have pretrained models that can be downloaded that are based on large amounts of text. Words may be represented very differently in those vs whatever we train here - the more data we have, the more consistent they'll be; the more \"unique\" our text is, the more different it will be. If we were, for example, working in a specific domain such as patent law, we could use a large amount of patent law text to train a model that would be more consistent with our domain. Or, perhaps more likely, we could use a pretrained model that has been created with massive amounts of training data. \n",

Here, the model is looking at semantic similarity, the \"meaning\" of each word, in the context of our text, is being compared and the most similar words are returned. Note that we can only calculate similarity here for words that we have in our vocabulary. This is one place where large language models like chat GPT have a massive advantage, their vocabulary is huge. "

    "When we do the intial training of the word2vec model (not when we are making final predictions), we are using our corpus to generate the space and the embeddigns for all of our tokens. We can also download a pretrained model, that already has the N-dimensional space defined (when it was trained on some different data), and use that to generate our embeddings. This is a common practice, and can be a good way to get started. Gensim has several models that have been trained on varying amounts of data, they are listed here: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data along with several other datasets that we could use to train a model. \n",

    "So if we are using some text from wikipedia (like the second example), the space in which embeddings are made is defined by the text in wikipedia. So the \"closeness\" in meaning of words is based on what is in that corpus. We then take our tokens and calculate their embeddings in that space. The big advantage to this is someone else can train a model on lots of data, which hopefully generates a better understanding of the relationships between words, and we can then just score our words on those scales. This approach is common in large models, like text processing or image recognition, where the training load can be too large for \"regular folk\". We can also take these trained models and \"customize\" them to our data, we'll look at that with image recognition at the end of the semester. \n",

    "<li> They are trained on much larger datasets. Very, very, very large datasets. In NLP specifically, this helps because it can help address the problem with us having so many words, many of which aren't used super often - i.e. the fact that there are a lot of words that don't occur together in the same sentence. If the training data is massive (e.g. \"the internet\"), we massively reduce the impact of this problem, as we see each word many times. \n",

    "    <ul>\n",

So the model is more able to deal with data in its raw form, and doesn't need to be preprocessed as much separately, in advance. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Manual intervention is used, humans provide examples of convesation, define labels, and evaluate the quality of the model's work. You may have heard news of Kenyans being paid low wages to label data for these models.\n",
    "<li> Other model types are used to help, such as reinforcement learning. Responses that are good are rewarded, and those that are bad are punished. This helps the model learn what is good and what is bad. This is particularly useful for generative models, such as chatGPT.\n",
